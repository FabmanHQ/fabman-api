## Possible field values

An activity log record contains multiple enumeration fields:

* `type` can be one of:
	* `'denied'`: Access to an equipment was denied.
	* `'allowed'`: Access to an equipment was granted.
	* `'pairing'`: A new bridge was connected to an equipment.
	* `'keyAssigned'`: A new key was assigned to a member.
	* `'checkIn'`: Someone checked in.

	* `'resourceDisabled'`: An equipment was put out of order by an admin.
	* `'resourceEnabled'`: An equipment was re-enabled by an admin.

* `stopType` can be either `null` (if not appilcable or not yet stopped) or one of:
	* `'normal'`: The activity was stopped manually by the user.
	* `'automatic'`: The activity was stopped automatically (usually because of a dead-man timeout).
	* `'offline'`: The activity was stopped while the equipment was offline. (So the time might not be 100% accurate.)
	* `'takeover'`: The next user took over while the equipment was running.
	* `'filter'`: The activity was stopped due to a filter alert.
	* `'permission'`: The activity was stopped because the user’s permission expired.
